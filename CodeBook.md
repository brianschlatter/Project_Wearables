I copied the original data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Please see the Readme file contained in that zip to get details on the original data. 

This script converted that data in the following way:
1) Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Created descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Created better label for the features. No "()" or "-"  
5) Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Here are the column labels for the final tidy data set.
"SubjectID" "ClassLabelFriendly" "tBodyAcc.mean...X" "tBodyAcc.mean...Y" "tBodyAcc.mean...Z" "tBodyAcc.std...X" "tBodyAcc.std...Y" "tBodyAcc.std...Z" "tGravityAcc.mean...X" "tGravityAcc.mean...Y" "tGravityAcc.mean...Z" "tGravityAcc.std...X" "tGravityAcc.std...Y" "tGravityAcc.std...Z" "tBodyAccJerk.mean...X" "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Y" "tBodyAccJerk.mean...Z" "tBodyAccJerk.std...X" "tBodyAccJerk.std...Y" "tBodyAccJerk.std...Z" "tBodyGyro.mean...X" "tBodyGyro.mean...Y" "tBodyGyro.mean...Z" "tBodyGyro.std...X" "tBodyGyro.std...Y" "tBodyGyro.std...Z" "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...X" "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Y" "tBodyGyroJerk.mean...Z" "tBodyGyroJerk.std...X" "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Y" "tBodyGyroJerk.std...Z" "tBodyAccMag.mean.."
